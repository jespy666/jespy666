## Hey there!  

Web development experience covers **backend** - from quick MVPs on Django to fault-tolerant microservices with message queues and async processing.  

**Frontend skills** include building and integrating React/TypeScript single-page applications, implementing responsive layouts and UI components based on Figma or other design specs.  

Worked on **database** schema design, query optimization, and migration management for both SQL and NoSQL databases.  

Set up Docker-based **environments**, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring/logging with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Prometheus, Grafana, as well as remote server configuration.  

**Infrastructure design** aimed at stability and scalability, supporting the full project lifecycle from local development to production, always choosing the most appropriate architecture for the task (no microservices for simple systems).

**AI integrations** include connecting agents to chatbots and sales funnels, as well as call analytics and voice processing.  

Maintained automated **test coverage** above 75%, focusing on critical system parts and embedding tests into CI workflows.  

Implemented **authentication** and **authorization** using cookies, sessions, OAuth2, JWT, and two-factor authentication.  

Product decisions made with **business requirements** in mind; always ready to explain when a proposed solution isnâ€™t optimal and suggest alternatives.
